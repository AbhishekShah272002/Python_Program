# Problem: Write a program that replaces the placeholders in a string with user input.
# The program should take a name and a date as input from the user and replace the placeholders <|Name|> and <|Date|> in the string with the provided values.
letter = '''Dear <|Name|>,
            you are selected!
              <|Date|>'''
name = input("Enter your name: ")
date = input("Enter date: ")
letter = letter.replace("<|Name|>", name)
letter = letter.replace("<|Date|>", date)
print(letter)
# This is a multi-line string that contains placeholders <|Name|> and <|Date|>.
