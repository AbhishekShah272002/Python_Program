# Escape Sequences in Python
# Escape sequences are special characters that are used to represent certain characters in a string. They are used to insert characters that are not easily typed on a keyboard, such as newlines, tabs, and quotes. Escape sequences start with a backslash (\) followed by a character.
# Here are some commonly used escape sequences in Python:
# \n - Newline: Moves the cursor to the next line.
# \t - Tab: Inserts a tab space.
# \\ - Backslash: Inserts a backslash character.
# \' - Single Quote: Inserts a single quote character.
# \" - Double Quote: Inserts a double quote character. 
a = "Abhishek is a good boy \nbut he is not a good student"
 
print(a)
# \n is used to create a new line in the string

b = "Abhishek is\ta good boy"
print(b)
# \t is used to create a tab space in the string

c = "Abhishek is a good\"boy\""
print(c)
# \" is used to create a double quote in the string

d = "Abhishek is a good\'boy\'"
print(d)
# \' is used to create a single quote in the string

e = "Abhishek is a good\\boy"
print(e)
# \\ is used to create a backslash in the string
