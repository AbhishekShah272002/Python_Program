-> First thing comes in mind what is python?

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.

Here are the key points about Python:

Easy to learn and use: Python has a clean, straightforward syntax that resembles plain English.

Interpreted language: Python code is run line by line by an interpreter, which makes development fast and interactive.

Versatile: Used in web development, data analysis, machine learning, automation, scripting, and more.

Extensive libraries: Python has thousands of libraries like pandas, numpy, flask, and tensorflow that help with everything from math to web apps.

Cross-platform: Python runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and even embedded devices.
