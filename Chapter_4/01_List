# List in Python
# A list is a collection of items in a particular order.
# Lists are mutable, meaning they can be changed after creation.
# Lists are created using square brackets [] and can contain any data type.
# Lists can also contain other lists, tuples, or any other data type.
friends = ["Alice", 5, 34.05, "Bob", "Charlie", "David"]
print(friends)
print(friends[0])  # First element  
print(friends[1])  # Second element 
friends[0] = "Alex"  # Change first element
print(friends)  # First element after change
print(friends[0:3])  # First three elements
print(friends[1:4])  # Second to fourth elements
print(friends[1:])  # From second to end
