# Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
# Tuples are written with round brackets.
# Tuples are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed after creation.
# Tuples are created using parentheses () and can contain any data type.
# Tuples can also contain other tuples, lists, or any other data type.
# Tuples are often used to group related data together.
# Tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries, while lists cannot.
empty_tuple = () # Empty tuple
print(type(empty_tuple))  # <class 'tuple'>  
# Tuple with one element
single_element_tuple = (1,)  # Note the comma  
print(type(single_element_tuple))  # <class 'tuple'> 

a = (1) # This is not a tuple, it's just an integer 
print(type(a))  # <class 'tuple'>

a = (1,)  # This is a tuple with one element
print(type(a))  # <class 'tuple'>

b = (1, 2, 3)  # This is a tuple with three elements
print(type(b))  # <class 'tuple'>

value = (1, 2, 3, False, "Hello", 3.14, (1, 2, 3), [1, 2, 3])
print(value)  # (1, 2, 3, False, 'Hello', 3.14, (1, 2, 3), [1, 2, 3])
#tuple is immutable, so we cannot change the value of a tuple after it is created
# value[0] = 10  # This will raise a TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
